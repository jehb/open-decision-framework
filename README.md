# Open Public Decision Framework
This is a remix of the [Open Decision Framework](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework), a flexible, open approach to making decisions which was originally designed for business use. This version exists to apply the same decision making framework but modified to meet the unique challenges of public policy decisions.

While there is no particular implied scale in this framework, it is primary designed for local and municipal-level governments. We believe these decision-making priciples are useful at any level of government, including use in national and international decisions. However, our focus is on the local because of the order of magnitude more bodies of government and more decisions taking place at this level.

## Background
For the past few years at Red Hat, we’ve been grappling with the challenges of growing an open organization and sustaining our culture along the way. One tool we’ve been developing and testing is the Open Decision Framework, a collection of best practices for applying [open source principles](https://opensource.com/open-source-way) to business projects and decisions. 

The Open Decision Framework contains the collective wisdom of Red Hatters, compiled into a flexible framework that helps decision makers and leaders seek out diverse perspectives and collaborate across teams and geos, to make better decisions.
