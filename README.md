# Open Public Decision Framework
This is a remix of the [Open Decision Framework](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework), a flexible, open approach to making decisions which was originally designed for business use. This version exists to apply the same decision making framework but modified to meet the unique challenges of public policy decisions.

While there is no particular implied scale in this framework, it is primary designed for local and municipal-level governments. We believe these decision-making priciples are useful at any level of government, including use in national and international decisions. However, our focus is on the local because of the order of magnitude more bodies of government and more decisions taking place at this level.
